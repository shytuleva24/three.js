# Three.js Head Sculpture Project

Welcome to my Three.js head sculpture project! This project serves as a showcase of my skills in Three.js, where I practiced sculpting a female head figure, adjusted lighting, and implemented mathematical calculations to ensure realistic head movement following mouse interaction.

## About the Project

This project is an exploration of 3D modeling and rendering using the Three.js library. It features a female head sculpture created entirely with code, demonstrating my proficiency in creating realistic 3D objects and scenes in a web environment. The sculpture's movement is dynamically controlled by mouse input, providing an interactive and immersive experience.

## Key Features

- **Three.js Integration**: Utilizing the Three.js library for creating and rendering 3D graphics in the browser.
- **Dynamic Head Movement**: Implementing mouse interaction to dynamically rotate and move the head sculpture, providing a lifelike appearance.
- **Lighting Adjustment**: Fine-tuning lighting settings to enhance the visual appeal and realism of the head sculpture.
- **Mathematical Calculations**: Using mathematical calculations to ensure smooth and realistic head movement in response to mouse input.
